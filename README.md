# Names of New York [ReactJS/iOS/Android]

## Build a Name Generator App

Please have a working application to demo and modify during the interview. The technology must match the position you are applying for (React.JS, Android, or iOS).

## Name Generator

We are going to build a name generator for babies. The goal is to pick a popular name, but not always the most popular. Ideally our name generator will follow the underlying statistics of the data.

## Task

Add a page/screen with two buttons labeled "Female" and "Male". When one of these buttons is clicked, the application should randomly select a Name from the given dataset. The Name should be placed in a Card.

## Dataset

Our data consists of a list of arrays with information about baby name popularity. Each row has 1) Year of Birth, 2) Gender, 3) Ethnicity, 4) Name, 5) Number of Babies with this Name, and 6) Name's Rank. Initially we will use the static data below; however, by the end of the interview we expect to pull the data from an API (to be provided in the interview).
